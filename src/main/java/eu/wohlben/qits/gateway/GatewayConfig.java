 * shows up in logs and the health check, so a deployment can call them {@code qits}, {@code
 * artifacts}, {@code telemetry}, … Every route is resolved from configuration ONLY: the gateway
 * never derives an upstream host or port from anything in the request, which is the same SSRF guard
 * qits' own {@code ServiceProxyRoute} keeps (it resolves origins exclusively from supervisor
 * state).
 *
 * <p>Since config sources include environment variables, a route is fully declarable without a
 * file: {@code QITS_GATEWAY_ROUTES_ARTIFACTS_PATH_PREFIX=/api/artifacts}, {@code
 * QITS_GATEWAY_ROUTES_ARTIFACTS_HOST=qits-artifacts}, …
